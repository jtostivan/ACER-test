# ACER-test
Some quick notes about the project:
I primarily used the Bootstrap framework for this site, as it's quick and simple to implement static pages with. This could very easily be converted to pure HTML & CSS if required.
The site uses the base responsiveness Bootstrap offers, however it is not optimised for smaller screens, as that seemed outside the scope of this particular test. That said, the site could be made fully responsive with some edits; using media queries would be the most straightforward way to achieve this.
