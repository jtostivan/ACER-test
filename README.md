# ACER-test
Quick note about the project:
I primarily used the Bootstrap framework for this site, as it's quick and simple to implement static pages with, and the default responsiveness it offers is sufficient with the addition of a few media queries. This could very easily be converted to pure HTML & CSS if required.
